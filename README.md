# fMRI Image Denoising Training Pipeline (w Brightness Loss)

This project provides a training pipeline for medical image data in NIfTI format (`.nii.gz`). The pipeline is designed for flexibility and easy experimentation using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Requirements

Make sure to install all dependencies, including:

* Python 3.8+
* NumPy
* PyTorch
* Nibabel
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter

---

### 🧪 Creating a Conda Environment

To create a Conda environment with all required dependencies:

1. Ensure you have [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed.

2. Run the following command from the project directory:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate mri_project
```

---

### 1. Prepare Your Data

* Place your training `.nii.gz` files in the `data/` folder.
* Place your validation `.nii.gz` files in the `validation/` folder.

### 2. Customize Parameters

You can customize various training parameters inside the notebook:

* **Learning Rate**
* **Optimizer**
* **Batch Size**
* **Number of Epochs**

Modify these settings in the notebook to experiment with different training configurations.

---

### 3. Train the Model

Run the `final_train.ipynb` notebook to:

* Load and preprocess the data
* Set up the model and training parameters
* Train the model
* Evaluate the results on the validation set



## 📈 Output

* The notebook will display training loss and validation metrics.
* You can modify it to save models, logs, or predictions as needed.
